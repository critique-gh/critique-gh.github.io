# Welcome

I am Jay,
this is a place where i write my thesis, that no one reviews, poetry that no one reads, blogs that are only meant for me. No one is going to read this page, except webcrawlers and bots maybe

### things i like
- Technology
    - opensource
    - linux
    - vim/neovim
- Reading(only idea of reading i don't usually read)
- Treating every human interaction like a social experiment(i stole that line from somewhere)
- Intellectualizing my suffering(the spelling is wrong i guess)
